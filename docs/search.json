    "text": "This report will present a detailed analysis of mobility patterns in the Metropolitan Region of Buenos Aires (RMBA), over the last four years, taking into account the gender variable. The information presented has been compiled by the consulting firm Nommon, which has conducted comprehensive studies on mobility in the city in previous years.\nThe main objective of this report is to analyze how gender differences influence mobility patterns in Buenos Aires, taking into account factors such as the most used means of transportation, the distances traveled and the most trafficked areas.\nIt is hoped that the results of this study will allow authorities and citizens in general to better understand the mobility needs and preferences of different gender groups, which could contribute to the creation of more inclusive and equitable public policies."
